### Saludos/Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm pretherox, and i'm participating at the #30NitesOfCode to assist me on creating a daily routine of coding so I can focus
on creating my projects and learn more about coding.
As I do, I had been entrusted with a small companion that will acompany me during my journey.
